				<h2>Week 6 Technical Blog - Ruby Classes & Modules</h2>

					<p>
						For this weeks technical blog post I've decided to go over the difference between
						Ruby classes and modules.  There is much confusion between the difference and when
						to use one or the other.  I hope by the time you are done reading, you will have a
						better understanding of the two and when to use them.  If you haven't already, take
						a second to review the first image above this paragraph and then lets start with the
						Ruby class.
					</p>
					<h2>Ruby Class</h2>
					<p>
						Classes are blue prints.  They describe how to build an object.  They lay out objects
						characteristics(Variables) as well as abilities(Methods).  This set of blue prints
						is used to instantiate an object(build and object).  Classes are created using the
						class keyword.  You can read more about classes by reading <a href="week5_technical.html">my previous technical blog
						post from last week.</a> 
					</p>
					<p>
						Classes are the building blocks of Object Oriented Programming.  They allow us to model
						real world things and ideas as well as providing a way of organizing our code.  Everything
						in Ruby is an object created from a class.  Arrays are objects created from the array class.
						Strings are objects created from the string class.
					</p>
					<p>
						To use these classes we create or instantiate them.  We say, for example, my_array = Array.new or
						we say my_array = [].  Both are creating a new Array object that holds state for that copy.
					</p>
					<p>
						Classes can also inherit from one another.  For example, the Array and String classes derive from the
						base class object.  They inherit characteristics from object much the way a child would inherit traits
						from it's parents.  This give flexibility to how we model objects in Ruby but there are limitations as
						well.  For instance, you can only inherit from one other class.  This can be limiting and while other
						programming languages let you inherit form multiple classes or even to create interfaces, Ruby does 
						not.  This is where modules come in.
					</p>
					<h2>Ruby Modules</h2>
					<p>
						Modules are very much like classes and they even resemble them in code layout.  They can have 
						methods.  Those methods can be instance or module much like class methods can be instance or class.  
						However, the main difference is that modules are declared using the module keyword and CANNOT be instantiated.
						Modules can also have constants
					</p>
					<p>
						Modules can be included in other classes.  When included, the modules methods and variables are then 
						made available to that class. They are now "Mixed In" with the class.  Because of this, Modules allow 
						us a great way to extend functionality of a class.  It is also important to remember that when including
						a module in a class, only instance methods for the module would be available to the class much the way
						that class methods are not available to an instantiated object of a class.
					</p>
					<p>
						Modules are also a great way to package your code.  They can be used to group together methods, classes
						and constants that can then be used via the require keyword.  Using modules this way provide a name space
						and remove the worry of naming conflicts.  If we require a module in Ruby and that module has a variable
						or method name that is the same as a variable or method in our current code we do not have to worry about
						the ambiguity errors as we can call the module method through the modules name
					</p>
					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>
						Modules are a very powerful way to extend the functionality of classes when inheritance isn't enough.  They
						also provide a great way to package code into name spaces.  Classes are the building blocks of Ruby's 
						Object Oriented roots and allow for modeling of real world things and ideas.  Classes and be instantiated
						while modules can not.  For more details, please read more about Classes and Modules below.
