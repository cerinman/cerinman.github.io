						Everything is an object in Ruby.  All the way down to numbers and strings.  And that is a
						great way to look at it too because everything inherits from object.  Object is the root
						Ruby class that everything is built on.
					</p>
					<p>
						For that is what an object is, a Ruby class.  A class describes what an object is, what it
						can do, how it works.  This fundamental construct is the basis of all object oriented programming
						languages.  It is this ability to define classes or objects that gives the ability to model
						real world objects and ideas.  It is also the power and grace behind object oriented programming.
					</p>
					<h2>Inheritance</h2>
					<p>
						Inheritance goes hand in hand with Ruby classes/objects.  It is this concept that allows objects
						to have relationships.  Golden Retrievers and Poodles are both dogs so wee could say that 
						Golden Retrievers and Poodles inherit from dog.  All dogs have similar traits and abilities.
						They bark, they dig holes, they wag their tails.  These common abilities and traits are abstracted
						away to a dog class.
					</p>
					<p>
						We could then have a class for Golden Retriever that inherits the traits and abilities from dog.
						We could then create as many unique Golden Retrievers as we wished and they would all be able to
						bark, dig holes, and wag their tails.
					</p>
					<h2>The Dog Class</h2>
					<p>
						Using this new knowledge, let's build our first dog class and give it some abilities.  We'll give
						our dog a name and the ability to bark, wag his tail, and dig a hole.  We'll also store his name
						in an instance variable so that it can be retrieved and set at will.  This variable will only be
						available to an instance of our Dog class rather than the class itself.  We denote this by placing
						an @ symbol in front of the name of the variable.
					</p>
					<p>
						We'll also use the attr_accessor to auto create methods to set and retrieve the @name variable on
						and instance of our Dog class.  Rather than creating a method to return the name and a method to
						set the name, we use this as a short cut.  You can also use attr_reader to only create the method
						to retrieve or just the attr_writer to only create the method to set.
