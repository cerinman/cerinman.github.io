        <h3>Pair Programming</h3>
        <h4>
          What it means
        </h4>
        <p>
          Pair programming is the practice of two programmers working together to solve a problem or challenge.  The pair designates a driver and a navigator.  The driver does the typing or coding at the direction of the navigator.  The roles of driver and navigator are switched periodicly so that both programmers can give voice and learn from the session.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal is to communicate effectivley, to be kind, and to solve the problem at hand.  Pairing is a great way to grow your skills as a programmer and to learn from others.

          Ori and I both have a similar outlook on the importance of pair programming.  Our combined effort allowed us to work through material quickly and we learned from each other's coding styles.  We also agree that explaining concepts as the navigator really helped us to make ideas concrete within our own minds.

          We were able to see syntax and typo errors quicker than we would have other wise.  We also found that when one of use did't remember how to do something that the other usually had the answer on hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Switching back and forth as navigator and driver also worked well for us.  Starting as the driver, Ori was able to ease into the session and build his confidance.  As navigator, I was able to get over my nerves of our first GPS.

          Sharing these responsibilities is important.  Giving equal voice to each member of the pair delivers a great product and helps both parties learn and grow.
