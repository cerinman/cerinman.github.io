				<h2>Week 3 Cultural Blog - My Mind Styles</h2>
				<div id="text">
				<p>
					The Mind Style model created by <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Anthony Gregorc</a> is a well known way of how to consider the way the mind works.
				</p>
				<p>
					Through a simple test, one can determine a thinking style for themselves based upon 4 qualities or abilities.  These "abilities" describe how a person perceives and organizes information.
				</p>
				<p>
					These four abilities are:
					<ul>
						<li>Concrete</li>
						<li>Abstract</li>
						<li>Sequential</li>
						<li>Random</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<h2>
					Concrete
				</h2>
				<p>
					The Concrete Perceptual quality is the ability of someone to register information using their five senses.  The information at hand is obvious, literal, or "It is what it is."  It is a very logical way of looking at things.
				</p>
				<h2>Abstract</h2>
				<p>
					The abstract perceptual quality allows a person the ability to visualize or understand things that are not actually seen.  This is more of an intuition based quality where use of the imagination to conceive ideas is relied upon.
				</p>
				<h2>Sequential</h2>
				<p>
					The sequential ordering ability allows the mind to organize information into a linear step by step way.  People with this ability tend to follow a logical train of thought.
				</p>
				<h2>Random</h2>
				<p>
					The random ordering ability is best described by organizing information into chunks and not into any particular order.  People with this ability tend to skip steps in a procedure but still produce the desired out come.
				</p>
				<h2>What am I?</h2>
				<p>
					So what am I you ask?  Well, I'm a mixture.  I've taken the test 3 times now and I've come up with the same answers every time.  I identify as Concrete Random/Abstract Sequential.  
				</p>
				<p>
					I experiment to find answers(Concrete Random), I can work through problems on my own(Concrete Random), I spend time analyzing situations before making decisions(Abstract Sequential), and I learn best when I have access to experts and reference(Abstract Sequential).
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course there is much more but these are the things that really jumped out at me as I read the definitions for the the different <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Mind Styles</a>.
				</p>
				<h2>Dev Bootcamp to the rescue!</h2>
				<p>
					I've always felt that I do best in learning environment where I am shown examples and given access to experts on the subject.  I strongly identify with the Abstract Sequential part of my results from this test.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also do extremely well in environments that I consider stimulating and exciting.  I can't thank of but a few other places that would be as rewarding and fun as Dev Bootcamp.  I think that I knew this even before I applied or understood my mind style.
				</p>
				<p>
					I can see that I also need to be apart of a community.  I think that has been the key piece that I've been missing to really take my programming chops to the next level.  To be surrounded by other programmers has been a dream of mine and I've always let my introvert personality get in the way of really joining a community.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now that I know what I need to succeed I plan on being more involved.  To ask questions.  To tap into my instructors experience.  I also plan on being in the moment and giving my all so that the environment stays exciting and rich.  I can see how this really is what you make of it.
