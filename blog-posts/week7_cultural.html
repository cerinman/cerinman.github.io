          <h2>Exploring my values</h2>
          <p>
            Having a family, Inner harmony, Meaningful work.  These are the three key values that
            jumped out at me as I read through the list.  Looking back at my 35 years on this earth
            I can see that times that I was the most happy was when these three values aligned. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Of the three values that stand out, I've decided to write a few sentences on having a 
            family.  I've been a husband for 10 years now and a father for 8.  My extended family is 
            large and close.  I can't think of a single major milestone in my life where family was
            not involved in either getting me there are celebrating my success at the end.
          </p>
          <p>
            They encourage me, they push me, they love me even if I fail.  They are the center and
            they make everything worth it.  I strive to be a great husband and father and I work
            to make sure my family is taken care of.  They are my life.
          </p>
          <p>
            On a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being that I agree, I would say that I am on the 5 end of the
            scale every time when it comes to my family.  I would not be attending DBC if it was not
            for them and their support.  I always do my best to love and support them.
          </p>
          <h2>Removing Stereotype threat by focusing on my values</h2>
          <p>
            Coming to DBC is a scary thing and I have preconceived ideas of how I should do and what
            constitutes success while I'm in San Francisco and shortly after graduation.  I'm an 
            introvert and a nerd so I worry about a lot of stuff.
          </p>
          <p>
            My hope is that my family's support and love keeps me focused and working hard no matter
            the outcome.  They have never considered me a failure and they never will.  That is heartening
            to me.  I plan to focus on them a lot as things get hard.  I want them to be proud of me
            and I want this to be an avenue to greater things for myself and them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever I am down I plan on thinking about the new adventures DBC will allow for my family
            and I.  I plan to keep them for most in my mind and remember that they are rooting for me to
            not only succeed but to enjoy this once in a life time experience.
