						I'm white, nerdy, and an introvert.  I'll let that sink in for a moment.  I'm
						white, nerdy, and an introvert.  Can you think of some characteristics for these
						things that I identify as?  I know I can and no I don't dress up like a character
						from Star Wars or Star Trek and attend conventions on the weekends.  I don't live
						in my mother's basement.  But I am working towards being a software engineer though so
						you got me there.
					</p>
					<p>
						Stereotype Threat is the threat of being viewed through the lens of a negative stereotype
						or the fear of doing something that would inadvertently confirm that stereotype.
					</p>
					<p>
						Claude M. Steele, a leading researcher into Stereotype threat has done numerous tests
						and experiments into the subject.  Dr. Steele talks at length in the linked lecture
						below, that we tend to under perform in situations where stereotype threat is present.  
					</p>
					<p>
						In one of his experiments, Dr. Steele describes giving a very complex math test to the students 
						at the University of Michigan that were in the Engineering and Math departments.  When the 
						test was administered with no attempt to lift the stereotype
						that women were poor at math, the women inevitably did much worse than their male counterparts.
						But when an effort was taken before the test to tell the students that on average, male and
						female students did the same, the women excelled and far out scored their male counterparts.

					</p>
					<p>
						Through out my life I've considered myself an introvert.  I don't dislike people and I most
						certainly do NOT think I'm better than others but I need my private time to recharge my 
						batteries.  I remember in college hearing people make remarks about my absence from parties
						and social gatherings, noting that I thought I was better than everyone else or that I hated
						this person or that person.
					</p>
					<p>
						I also remember being confronted at one such social gathering by someone that thought I hated
						them because I came to this party but not theirs.  I'm not a confrontational person and the 
						ordeal only served to make me never want to attend another social gathering ever again.
					</p>
					<p>
						The pressure to fit in and to be social only made me more awkward in those situations and I can
						see now, having read Dr. Steele's work, that I was under performing because I was trying to
						hard to avoid the stereo type or the confrontation that might come from the stereo type.
					</p>
					<p>
						Dr. Steele goes on to talk about how participants in his experiments almost always noted that they
						did not consider themselves in a stereotype threat situation.  As if they were denying the
						situation of the problem.
					</p>
					<p>
						He also noted that the physiological data collected from each participant always showed elevated
						blood pressure, heart rate, quickened breathing, and activation of the parts of the brain that
						are reserved for dealing with threat rather than for reasoning and thinking.
					</p>
					<p>
						Watching the above video, I was also struck when he pointed out that the participants with the
						strongest responses where those that had the most desire to succeed in the area that the 
						experiment was conducted in.  The women math students in Michigan that had dedicated their 
						lives to math and loved it almost always had the strongest response and under performance.
					</p>
					<p>
						I can see these traits in myself.  I love computers and software engineering.  I want so badly
						to be a professional software engineer.  I can't help but wonder if I don't sabotage myself
						because of the stereotypes that I place on my introvert personality.
					</p>
					<p>
						I was feeling very down after watching Dr Steele discuss stereotype threat but then he got the 
						part about lifting the threat.
					</p>
					<p>
						I especially like the part where he discusses his college professor that took interest in him
						and constantly made him feel like he had the ability and talent to succeed.  This one little
						thing helped to lesson the effects of the many stereotype threat cues that he encountered as a
						young African American man in college.
					</p>
					<p>
						Seeing the possibilities in someone is not always the easiest thing but the impact we can have on
						other people when we tell them that they are capable and have talent is great indeed.  Often the
						factor that breaks down stereotypes is the ability to communicate with one another and in re-enforce
						the positive and the abilities in others.  I appreciate Dr. Steele's work and I'm glad I've had a 
						chance to study it.  I would highly recommend you take the time to at least watch the linked video
						above.  I've also linked a few more resources below for further studio.
