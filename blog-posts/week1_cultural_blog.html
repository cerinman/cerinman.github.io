					I'm an introvert.  There I said it.  Don't get me wrong, I like people, but I have to spend time on my own to recharge my battery frequently or I'll go insane.  The DBC experience scares me because of this.  It's also the reason I choose DBC to begin with.  To grow as a person and a developer, I must interact with other developers.  I feel like DBC's focus on being a professional person first and then a programmer sold me.  I've always learned best by doing and I can see myself coming out at the end of this, not just a better programmer, but a better person.
				</p>
				<p>
					My initial impression about DBC was that of skepticism.  I've been self learning programming in a wide verity of frameworks for several years now and I've always felt like I couldn't punch through the barrier that would take me on to being a professional full time programmer.  It seems like I cause more bugs than I solve problems some times.  How could DBC take me and make me employable in just 9 weeks.
				</p>

					Shereef's story about how he started Dev Bootcamp really resonated with me.  I'm an IT guy and I have been for years.  Much like Shereef's friend, I too felt stuck in a career where I couldn't do much more or be creative.  I first heard Shereef's story when I stumbled upon the Dan Rather report where Shereef told the story.  My wife said, "That sounds just like you".  She pushed me to accept that I needed to do this and she has been so supportive.  Some times it takes someone believing in you to convince you of your potential.
				</p>
				<p>
					I plan on taking full control of my education at DBC.  I plan on being social to the max.  I plan on working long hours.  I plan on helping others wherever my current knowledge will allow me to do so.  I plan on making this a once in a lifetime experience that will be with me forever.  I can't afford anything less.  I can't go back to being just an IT guy.  I can't NOT be creative.  I have to build.  I have to contribute.
				</p>
				<p>
					My expectations for DBC have not changed over the last several months.  I do believe my expectations of myself have though.  I'm tired of being a fixed mindset introverted person.  Stuck believing that I can't be some better version of myself.  I fully expect that I will be a better person at the end of this.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm nervous, scared, excited, and overwhelmed.  I feel like I'm somewhere in the middle of the "Two Fears" that Shereef talked about.  There are things I feel confident in and there are others that I don't.  I'm excited to be immersed in coding.  I'm scared I will fail.  I'm scared I will succeed.  I'm nervous others won't like me.  I'm scared I'm to old to fit in with the younger crowd.
				</p>
				<p>
					I could go on for days but I don't have time.  There is so much to do.  Shereef's video only made me more sure of my decision.  DBC or bust!  Go big or go home!
