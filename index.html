				<h2>Welcome Everyone!</h2>

					<p>
						Thanks for stopping by and checking out my DBC course work.  This website has been a lot of fun to make and I hope that you enjoy it!
					</p>
					<p>
						A little about myself to get you started.  My name is Tommy Dugger and I'm a computer geek.  If it's technology based then I most likely dig it.  I'm 35 years old, married, and have 2 children.  I currently live in Cortez Colorado and have lived in this area of the US for almost my entire life.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm a Systems Administrator for a construction company here and I spend my days taking care of computers, networks, and doing some programming in .Net/C#.  I've been in IT my entire career and I'm a bit burnt to say the least. 
					</p>
					<p>
						That is why I'm attending DBC.  I love programming and this is my chance to move into something I love.  There isn't much better than having a positive impact on someone through software that you had a hand in writing.  It's a great high and one that I want to stay on.
					</p>
					<p>
						Take a look around and give me ideas or feedback if you want.  You can find my email, github, and twitter accounts linked at the bottom right.  Thanks again for stopping by!
